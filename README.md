**Uifry - A Web App Built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS**

**Project Overview**

Uifry is a single-page web application designed and built using modern web technologies. It showcases a clean and user-friendly interface, adhering to the design principles outlined in the Figma design reference (link provided below).

**Technologies Used**

- **Vite:** A lightning-fast development server for a smooth development experience.
- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides a robust and customizable foundation for styling components.

**Running the Project Locally**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal. If not installed, download them from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)).

2. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone the Uifry project repository from your version control system (e.g., Git) using the appropriate command.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   (If you're using yarn, use `yarn install` instead.)

4. **Development Server:** Start the development server to launch Uifry locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   (For yarn, use `yarn dev`.)

   This will typically start the server on http://localhost:3000 (the default port for Vite development servers). You can open this URL in your web browser to view the running application.

**Design Choices and Libraries**

- **Design Refernce:** [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1145991068621514311)

- **Libraries:** react-router-dom, react-icons

**Additional Notes**

- For a more detailed development workflow, consider creating additional scripts in your `package.json` file (e.g., for building the project for production).
- Feel free to customize the project further by adding new features or modifying the existing design.
